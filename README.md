An image where silence speaks. The silhouettes of trees, boats, and birds exist not just as objects, but as archetypes—guardians of memory, vessels of becoming, and spirits of freedom. Drenched in surreal color, this seascape becomes a dream-space: a place to leave behind what was, and embrace what might be. It’s not just about escape—it’s about becoming. It’s a place for reflection, escape, and a reminder that beauty often exists in transitions.
